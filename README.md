liwords
=======

An open source (eventually) online word puzzle game, inspired (in name and clean design) by lichess.

### Installation

liwords uses Flask and Jinja2, and currently nothing else. However, this might change in the very near future, because the application is in a desperate need for some form of database.

    easy_install Flask
    easy_install jinja2

The wordlist (not provided here) and puzzle list (generated by generate.py) need to be present in the wordlist directory:

    wodlist/
      wodlist
      puzzles
      
These will probably also be moved to a database in later releases.

To start the server, use the following command:

    python ./server.py
    
The server runs on port 5000 by default. This will be configurable in later releases.
