liwords
=======

An open source (eventually) online word puzzle game, inspired (in name and clean design) by lichess.

### Installation

liwords uses the [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) framework with the [Jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/) template engine and [dataset](https://github.com/pudo/dataset) as a wrapper for the SQLite database.

A list of acceptable words needs to be imported into the database using the following command:

    python import_words.py -w <wordlist>
      
Using this list, puzzles have to be generated by the generator:

    python generate_puzzle.py -h
    usage: generate_puzzle.py [-h] [-c Cmd] [-g Size] [--min Val] [--max Val]
                              [--amount Val] [--big-word Length] [-v]

    python generate_puzzle.py --min 15 --max 25 --amount 1024 --big-word 6 --verbose

The `lang.json` file contains all the words that appear on the web interface.
When the server is started, it takes an argument, that specifies the language file location.
This value is `lang.json` by default.

To start the server, use the following command:

    python ./server.py [<lang_file>]
    
The server runs on port 5000 by default. 
This will be configurable in later releases.
