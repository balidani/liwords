liwords
=======

An open source (eventually) online word puzzle game, inspired (in name and clean design) by lichess.

### Installation

liwords uses the [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) framework with the [Jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/) template engine and [dataset](https://github.com/pudo/dataset) as a wrapper for the SQLite database.

The wordlist (not provided here) has to be present in the wordlist directory. It has to contain a list of words, one on each line.

    wordlist/
      wordlist
      
Using this list, puzzles have to be generated by the generator:

    python generate.py
    Usage: generate.py <grid_size> <score_limit> <amount>

To start the server, use the following command:

    python ./server.py
    
The server runs on port 5000 by default. This will be configurable in later releases.
